// Extra for Experts:
// - describe what you did to take this project "above and beyond"

// Goals:
// Get 2d grid set up
// maybe game of life with some extra rules
// - Like having a harm block
// - Don't take to much inspiration from the youtube video
// Maybe implement a 2d version of the Dilithium vector encryption.
// A* algorithm sounds pretty good
// - Rewatch the 3Blue1Brown video?
// Make a graphing calculator? That sounds a little complicated.
